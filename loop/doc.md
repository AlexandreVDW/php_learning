## Loop Exercices :

### 1.0. Exercises :

Here is an array :

```
$pronouns = array ('I', 'You', 'He/She','We', 'You', 'They');
```

Using foreach, build a loop that displays each element of the array

Then, modify your loop so as to conjugate the verb "to code" in the present tense. Use a <br> to go to the next line. The result should be :
```
- I code
- You code
- He/She codes
- We code
- You code
- They code
```
### 1.1. Exercices :

- Write a script that prints the numbers from 1 to 120 using  while 
- Write a script that prints the numbers from 1 to 120 using  for 

### 1.2. Exercices : 

Create an array containing the firstname of everyone in your startup. Display each firstname using a loop.

### 1.3. Exercices :

Create an array containing at least 10 countries. Then, generate the html that will render a select box inside an html form (see mockup below). Of course, a loop will be useful...

Now, edit your array so that it becomes an associative array: use the country ISO code as array key, and the country name as value. For example :Â´
```
$pays = array('BE'=>'Belgique');` 
```

Now, adapt your html select box so that the country ISO code becomes the <option> element value, and the country name be the visible part of the <option>.
